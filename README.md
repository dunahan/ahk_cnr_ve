# ahk_cnr_ve
A preview of a new version of the cnr script editor (acually only basic view)

Added bin-folder with compiled executable, folderstructure and some .nss-scripts from CNR 3.05

Now at version 0.802 the most data from the recipe is viewed. Changes to those scripts don't work yet, but will be in the future.
