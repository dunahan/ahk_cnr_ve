# ahk_cnr_ve
A preview of a new version of the cnr script editor (acually basic view and changes can be made/recognized).

Added bin-folder with compiled executable, folderstructure and some .nss-scripts from CNR 3.05

Now at version 0.802 the most data from the recipe is viewed. Changes to those scripts don't work yet, but will be in the future.
With version 0.803 all the data can be viewed and changes can be recognized.
