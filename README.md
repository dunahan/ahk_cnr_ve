# ahk_cnr_ve
A preview of a new version of the cnr script editor (acually basic view and changes can be made/recognized).

Added bin-folder with compiled executable, folderstructure and some .nss-scripts from CNR 3.05

Now at version 0.802 the most data from the recipe is viewed. Changes to those scripts don't work yet, but will be in the future.

With version 0.803 all the data can be viewed and changes can be recognized. 

At version 0.804 I did a rewrite of the save check. It should be better, but yet not super and final. Okay, did another change to the save func, it was to complicating (why do I think in such complicated ways?). For now, it isn't finshed yet, but it actualizes the script snippet at the recipe tab for the components and biproducts.
